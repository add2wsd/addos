AddOS is a script designed to automate the Arch Linux installation.

> [!WARNING]
> This script is in its beta phase. Features are missing, and it can potentially break your system. Confirmations before dangerous actions do not exist at this point. **Use at your own risk.**

## üìã Requirements

*   Live ISO Arch Linux environment.
*   Root privileges to run the script.
*   USB to execute the script, or Wi-Fi to wget.

## üöÄ Usage

1.  **Getting the Script:**

    *   **Online Method (requires internet connection on the Arch ISO USB):**
        ```bash
        wget https://github.com/add2wsd/addos/releases/download/latest/addosinstall.sh
        chmod +x addosinstall.sh
        ```
    *   **Offline Method (using Arch ISO USB):**
        1.  **On your current computer:** Download the `addosinstall.sh` script from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/add2wsd/addos/releases).
        2.    Copy this script file directly to the **root directory** of your Arch Linux installation USB drive (the same drive you'll boot from).
        3.  **On the target computer:** Boot your computer from the Arch Linux installation USB.
        4.  Once in the Arch Linux live environment, navigate to the USB's root directory, which is typically mounted at `/run/archiso/bootmnt`:
            ```bash
            cd /run/archiso/bootmnt
            ```
        5.  Make the script executable:
            ```bash
            chmod +x addosinstall-beta.sh
            ```

2.  **Run the script as root:**
    ```bash
    sudo ./addosinstall.sh
    ```
3.  **Confirm proceeding:** The script will prompt you to confirm due to its beta status and potential for system breakage. Type `y` to continue.
